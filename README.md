You have found the source code for the plugin Exploding Players.
As of this time, you would need to compile it yourself; womp womp.  Use Maven as the build tool.
Feel free to use any of the code.  Also, please use the plugin responsibly and don't blow people up for fun because you think it is fun.  Others will cry :(
